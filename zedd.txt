hello who is john is he anywhere near me could he be a dead man breathing in my mind is the end near can we please have a moment to recollect our simple thoughts and drain our sorrow with a barell pointed towards our nostrills to breathe in the smell of eminent doom this is what we have become a mere species sort that no longer exists only in our vivid visions do we protrey ourselves as a godlike society with many privilages over the lower standing animals but who are we to tell everyone how things should be run
we are not worthy
